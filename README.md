This is a collection of code snippets to demonstrate my past programming work.

The BoardGameMovement folder contains a collection of scripts pertaining to movement along a game board, as seen in my language learning RPG game.

The FlightSummonerScripts folder contains a collection of scripts made for my game jam game, Flight Summoner. This excludes the VR Toolkit scripts I used.

The VRNarrativeGame folder contains a script showcasing NPCs directing their eye contact to the player in VR, as well as a script that handles a mirror in VR.
